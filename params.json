It got\r\nassigned an issue number: _6_. Now whenever I decide to start working on that\r\nissue I'd like to be able to create a branch name for it quickly. Preferably\r\nsomething that will quickly let me know what issue I'm working on and something\r\nthat will be meaninful.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: `#6` Issue Title: `auto detect owner and repository`\r\n\r\nThe following branch is created: `6-auto-detect-owner-and-repository` by\r\nexecuting `ghib 6` in my project directory\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install -g ghib\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nWhile you are in your project directory do the following and a branch will be\r\ncreated for you (checkout master or whatever branch you need to first if\r\nnecessary, so the branch is created with the right parent).\r\n\r\n```\r\nghib <githubIssueNumber>\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
